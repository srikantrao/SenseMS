# Noise-DNN-And-Sensor-Efficacy
*****Incomplete GitHub as I privately work with the company to be sure that nothing deemed sensitive is released.*****

Consulting project to show the effects of noise on a deep neural network used to classify multiple sclerosis. I am completing this project as an Insight Fellow.

## Motivation for this project format:
- **Noise-DNN-And-Sensor-Efficacy** : Put all source code for production within structured directory
- **tests** : Put all source code for testing in an easy to find location
- **configs** : Enable modification of all preset variables within single directory (consisting of one or many config files for separate tasks)
- **data** : Include example a small amount of data in the Github repository so tests can be run to validate installation
- **build** : Include scripts that automate building of a standalone environment
- **static** : Any images or content to include in the README or web framework if part of the pipeline

## Setup
On AWS EC2 Ubuntu Deep Learning AMI version 20, run:
```shell
bash environment.sh
```

## Requisites

- List all packages and software needed to build the environment
- This could include cloud command line tools (i.e. gsutil), package managers (i.e. conda), etc.

#### Dependencies

- [Streamlit](streamlit.io)

#### Installation
To install the package above, please run:
```shell
pip install -r requirements
```

## Build Environment
- Include instructions of how to launch scripts in the build subfolder
- Build scripts can include shell scripts or python setup.py files
- The purpose of these scripts is to build a standalone environment, for running the code in this repository
- The environment can be for local use, or for use in a cloud environment
- If using for a cloud environment, commands could include CLI tools from a cloud provider (i.e. gsutil from Google Cloud Platform)
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Configs
- We recommond using either .yaml or .txt for your config files, not .json
- **DO NOT STORE CREDENTIALS IN THE CONFIG DIRECTORY!!**
- If credentials are needed, use environment variables or HashiCorp's [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)


## Test
- Include instructions for how to run all tests after the software is installed
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Run Inference
- Include instructions on how to run inference
- i.e. image classification on a single image for a CNN deep learning project
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Build Model
- Include instructions of how to build the model
- This can be done either locally or on the cloud
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Serve Model
- Include instructions of how to set up a REST or RPC endpoint
- This is for running remote inference via a custom model
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Analysis
- Include some form of EDA (exploratory data analysis)
- And/or include benchmarking of the model and results
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```
